# AUTOMATION FRAMEWORK BASED ON SELENIUM (JAVA)

## Installing the framework
1. Download the latest version of Java JDK. 
   - Go to https://www.oracle.com/es/java/technologies/downloads/ for download Java.
   - For Windows, use the "x64 MSI Installer".
   - For MAC, use the "DMG Installer" (ARM64 or x64 based on the OS).
2. Configure the environment variables (no "/" at the end of the path)
   - Copy the java home path (in general, this can be found in "C:/Program files/Java/jdk-XX"). Create JAVA_HOME in "system variables" and paste the Java path.
   - Copy the java bin directory path (in general, this can be found in "C:/Program files/Java/jdk-XX/bin"). Add it to "path" in "system variable".
   - Verify that Java is installed by openening the console and typing "java -version".
3.Download and install Eclipse (or any other IDE).
    - Go to https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ for download Eclipse.
    - For Windows, there is no installation: just download the files and open "eclipse. exe".
